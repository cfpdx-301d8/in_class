# Assignment for Class 10 - Pair Project

Apply what you've learned. With a pair, dive into a new code base and learn your way around.  You will need to perform a detailed code review on your pair's portfolio and vice-versa.  Upon completion of the code review, it's time to refactor!

## Technical Requirements

- Begin this process by performing a code review on your pair's portfolio assignment.  You should be the driver and will need to clone down your pair's portfolio.
- Your code review should include comments (or issues) with a brief technical description that describes your perspective on how any modifications should be approached.
- Be sure to approach your comments and issues with a "what" and "why" and let your pair determine the "how".
- Remember: A good code review is about perspective, understanding, and iteration.  Tone can be difficult to portray when doing a detailed code review so be sure to point out positive areas alongside areas of improvement.
- Submit a summary about your experience in Canvas with 1-2 tips that you learned from reviewing your pair's code.
