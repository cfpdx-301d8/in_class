# Portfolio Assignment for Class 9 - Refactoring

For this assignment, you will be refactoring your portfolio to better fit the OOP and FP principles that we have discussed over the last week.  Prior to refactoring, you will need to perform a detailed code review that includes comments (or issues) related to the area's that you will be modifying.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Ensure your code passes ESLint.
 - Peform a self-code-review, in GitHub, that details out line-item comments on previous PRs, or generates Issues on the areas that *you* will be refactoring
 - Your comments (or issues) should include high level technical details about how the related code should be refactored
  - Ex: _Use FP concepts and JS array methods to organize and/or manipulate my data._
 - Ensure that your JS *modules* are written in an OOP fashion and are now all wrapped in an IFFE in order to expose the *module* to the window.
 - Include a summary of your experience in your Canvas assignment submission.
 - Have fun, be creative, and take your code to the next level!
