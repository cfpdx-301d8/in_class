# Class 06 Portfolio assignment

## User Stories: MVP
 1. As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
 - As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

### User Stories: Stretch Goals
 - As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Transfer your collection of data over to a .json file, replacing your original file.
 - [JSON-Lint](http://jsonlint.com/) to the rescue!
 - Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
 - Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
 - Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!
