# Class 2 - jQuery and the DOM

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that gives developers a new way of interacting with the DOM. In lecture and assignments, you'll get a taste of what it can do, and practice using it to build your own apps.

## Lecture material

For each class, you'll find resources related to the lecture (like PDF of slides, video links, and example code from class) in the `lecture-code` subdirectory.

## Pair assignments

Throughout this course, you'll have a structured way to do "pair programming" with your classmates. You will have the opportunity to work with a number of your classmates, benefiting from their background and perspective, whether it's technical or otherwise.

Full instructions for what to do are found in your first pair assignment. See the `README.md` file, in the `pair-assignemnt` folder.

## Independent assignment

The majority of your daily programming practice should come from working on your independent assignments. Primarily, you'll be building yourself an online portfolio web site.

Your first independent assignment can be found in the `portfolio-assignment` subdirectory of every class folder.
