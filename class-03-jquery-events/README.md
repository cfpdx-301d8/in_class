# Class 3 - jQuery and Events

Today we will work on adding a very common feature of web pages: single-page tabs.

We will also give our blog readers the ability to select articles by category (or maybe even author name) as a way to filter the view.

We will use jQuery's event handling APIs to make this happen, rather than the vanilla JS methods.
